        <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
        <h2>Problem statement</h2>
<p>Loans are the building block for the overall growth in the sector of the money supply economy as the revenue generated from the interest and loans are the primary source for the banks. 
  The competition in the loan banking sector is increasing drastically which as a result also surges frauds and misunderstandings. 
  So, to mitigate the impacts on customers and banks the loan predictive analysis is the solution.</p>
<h2>Motivation for the problem</h2>
<p>Due to online banking, there is a huge number of data that can help the banks and users in the largest revenue generation prediction which is loans. 
  Now the question is why do we need the loan prediction analysis? A bank's profit or a loss depends to a large extent on loans i.e., whether the customers are paying back the loan or defaulting.
   By predicting the loan defaulters and categorizing the certain employment groups and their loan requirements at certain interest rates, the bank can reduce its Non- Performing Assets [1]. 
   This makes the study of this phenomenon very important. So, the idea of solving this problem motivated the concept of loan prediction analysis web application.
</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>We are thinking of developing a web application using the Python Flask where we will build a web form for applicants and banks. 
  Users will give some personal and employment details in the web form that are commonly taken by banks for the loan process. 
  Banks also will give their specific details like loan purpose, loan amount, interest, etc. which are required to get the details.
   We have a huge amount of data on loans where we will perform the KDD process like Data cleaning, warehousing and we get the task-relevant data from the form submitted by the user and query it from Apache Spark for the pattern evaluation, we are going to use python libraries like Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas and use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm to get the prediction and make visualizations. 
   From the results we obtained from algorithms, we will generate a report with visualizations and analysis.</p>

<h2>Project benefits</h2>
<p>This loan prediction application would benefit the customers applying for the bank loan and the banks to get the information about the loan defaulters and automate the loan eligibility process through predictive analysis. 
  The information generated from the predictive analysis would further also help to identify and target the specific group of customers by providing the certain benefits and interest rates by the banks.</p>

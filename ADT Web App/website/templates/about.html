      <h2 style ="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; font-size: large; font-weight: bolder; ">Problem statement</h2>
      <p style ="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; font-size: large; font-weight: bolder; ">
        Loans are the building block for the overall growth in the sector of the
        money supply economy as the revenue generated from the interest and
        loans are the primary source for the banks. The competition in the loan
        banking sector is increasing drastically which as a result also surges
        frauds and misunderstandings. So, to mitigate the impacts on customers
        and banks the loan predictive analysis is the solution.
      </p>
      <h2 style ="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; font-size: large; font-weight: bolder; ">Motivation for the problem</h2>
      <p style ="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; font-size: large; font-weight: bolder; ">
        Due to online banking, there is a huge number of data that can help the
        banks and users in the largest revenue generation prediction which is
        loans. Now the question is why do we need the loan prediction analysis?
        A bank's profit or a loss depends to a large extent on loans i.e.,
        whether the customers are paying back the loan or defaulting. By
        predicting the loan defaulters and categorizing the certain employment
        groups and their loan requirements at certain interest rates, the bank
        can reduce its Non- Performing Assets [1]. This makes the study of this
        phenomenon very important. So, the idea of solving this problem
        motivated the concept of loan prediction analysis web application.
      </p>
      <h2 style ="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; font-size: large; font-weight: bolder; ">Solution</h2>
      <p style ="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; font-size: large; font-weight: bolder; ">
        We are thinking of developing a web application using the Python Flask
        where we will build a web form for applicants and banks. Users will give
        some personal and employment details in the web form that are commonly
        taken by banks for the loan process. Banks also will give their specific
        details like loan purpose, loan amount, interest, etc. which are
        required to get the details. We have a huge amount of data on loans
        where we will perform the KDD process like Data cleaning, warehousing
        and we get the task-relevant data from the form submitted by the user
        and query it from Apache Spark for the pattern evaluation, we are going
        to use python libraries like Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas and use the
        Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm to get the
        prediction and make visualizations. From the results we obtained from
        algorithms, we will generate a report with visualizations and analysis.

      <h2 style ="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; font-size: large; font-weight: bolder;" >Project benefits</h2>
      <p style ="font-family: 'Dancing Script', cursive; font-size: large; font-weight: bolder;">
        This loan prediction application would benefit the customers applying
        for the bank loan and the banks to get the information about the loan
        defaulters and automate the loan eligibility process through predictive
        analysis. The information generated from the predictive analysis would
        further also help to identify and target the specific group of customers
        by providing the certain benefits and interest rates by the banks.
